* Aims to show which features of a college correlate to the largest post-graduation salary. Itâ€™s written in Stata and incorporates hypothesis testing, and regression and statistical analysis
* Prompt: Develop and estimate a model that attempts to explain the variation in mobility rates across colleges. how do post-college earnings vary as a function of tuition, expenditures per pupil, major, quality-of-student body as measured by performance on a standardized test, etc.  You may find a need to combine two or more data sets (e.g., you may want to combine information from the data sets. This can be done in Stata.
